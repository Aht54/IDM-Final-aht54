        <p>As I`ve gotten older, my definition of life has been constantly changing at an everyday pace. 
          Along the way, these 4 things have been the most recent passions that I`ve recently discovered by getting out of my comfort zone. 
          The one main lesson that I have learned from each of these passions is that anything new that you decide to take on, will always be a struggle initally but over time, 
          it can be polished to a very useful skills I`ve personally symbolized.</p>

          <h2>Photography</h2>
          <p>I was always drawn to Photography in a way where I was afraid from making the transition to a higher level because of how addicted it could be. Turns out... 
            I was right! Now I almost always have my camera on me and ready to capture anything that catches my eye.</p>

          <h2>Volleyball</h2>
          <p>I started playing Volleyball in High School and it was one of the best decisions I`ve ever made. The sport taught me how to build connections and emphasized the critical importance of an team environment. 
            Growing up I had a hard time opening up to people and had a constant sense of self-reliance which I`m glad to have grown out of.</p>

          <h2>Drawing</h2>
          <p>When I saw a drawing course on my schedule for the fall term, I was honestly not looking forward to it at all because of the thought of overwhelming embarassment.
             I`ve never been a fan of drawing nor had the talent but over the course of this term, I now realize that I just had to give the process a chance. 
            Looking back at my struggles in the beginning and comparing it to the results now, I`m proud of what I was able to accomplish.</p>

          <h2>Video Editing</h2>
          <p>Video Editing is something I`ve always been curious about getting into along with photo editing. 
            I'm always amazed by the fact at how videos and photos on the internet are published with such high 
            quality. From the edits, shots, animations, and most of all the passion you can feel from viewing the work
            is something I want to experience and share with others.

            <h2>Web Developemnt</h2>
            <p>This is my very first design based off of the coding languages I learned in my first UX-related Course. 
              I explored the principles and techniques used for creating Mobile First, Responsive websites using basic HTML5 and CSS3.</p>

            <h1>Project 2</h1>
            <h2>Web Design</h2>
            <p>The main takeaway was that my idea revolved around the simplicity of just advertising what the business was known for, 
              but instead I played it too safe which left the website lacking key aspects. I’ve learned that taking risks is never always a bad decision, just as long as they`re calculated and concise.</p>

            <h2>Drawings</h2>
            <p>I actually started out a pretty bad drawer with minimal skills and knowledge of how to create decent imagery. 
              But within the UXID Program at Drexel, came the opportunity to take VSST courses which were basically classes based around the basics of art such as drawing, sketching, etc.</p>

            <h2>Coding is Love</h2>
            <p>Photography has always been a passion of mine right from when I was able to have my first cellphone. 
              At first, it was enjoyable casually capturing memories in important moments of my life. 
              My first sunset, sunrise, a birthday I actually remember, first basketball game, you name it. 
              I always made sure to take a photo because I wanted it to be something I’d never forget while also being able to look back at it in the future.</p>

            <p>My very first video editing related project was created during the fall of 2022. I created a stop-motion project or rather 
              claymation to represent a bit of a story where everyone can relate to. Life is full of ups and downs but what matters is how we 
              fight back.

        <h2>Aspiring UXID Designer</h2>
        <p>I am a second year undergrad at Drexel University pursuing a degree in UXID. 
          I come from a fairly stereotypical household that stressed on having a career in the medical/engineering field but made a decision on pursuing something in life that 
          I would enjoy doing for a long time while also hitting every music festival possible of course.
